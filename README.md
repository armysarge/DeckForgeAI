# DeckForgeAI - Hearthstone Card Database & Deck Manager

A powerful toolset for managing Hearthstone decks and querying the complete Hearthstone card database. Includes AI-powered deckbuilding to optimize strategies and streamline gameplay planning.

## Project Roadmap

Current development status as of April 9, 2025:
- âœ… Build SQLite DB (Done)
- ðŸ”„ Query cards (Still in progress)
- ðŸ”œ Deck Management (Coming Soon)

## Features

- Fetches all Hearthstone cards from the HearthstoneJSON API
- Stores cards in a SQLite database with comprehensive card attributes
- Provides a query tool for searching and filtering cards

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  - `requests`
  - `sqlite3` (included in Python standard library)

## Installation

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Building the Database

To build or update the card database:

```bash
python buildDB.py
```

This will:
1. Create a new SQLite database named `hearthstone_cards.db` in the current directory (or update if it already exists)
2. Fetch the latest card data from HearthstoneJSON API
3. Insert all cards into the database

### Querying the Database

The `query_cards.py` script provides various options for querying the database:

```bash
# List all card classes
python query_cards.py --list-classes

# List all card sets
python query_cards.py --list-sets

# List all card types
python query_cards.py --list-types

# List all card rarities
python query_cards.py --list-rarities

# Search for cards by name (case insensitive, partial match)
python query_cards.py --name "dragon"

# Search for cards by class
python query_cards.py --class "MAGE"

# Search for cards by mana cost
python query_cards.py --cost 7

# Search for collectible cards only
python query_cards.py --name "dragon" --collectible

# Combine multiple search criteria
python query_cards.py --class "WARLOCK" --rarity "LEGENDARY" --collectible

# Get a specific card by ID
python query_cards.py --id "EX1_572"

# Increase the number of results (default is 10)
python query_cards.py --name "beast" --limit 50
```

## API Information

This project uses the [HearthstoneJSON API](https://hearthstonejson.com/), which provides data about all Hearthstone cards in JSON format.
